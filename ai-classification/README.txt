# AI Classification

This is my AI Classification project which was my final project for Artificial intelligence in Fall 2025. 

The code section includes 3 files. Two of the python notebook files are the same, the only difference is one uses 2 epochs, 
while the other uses 4. The third file is the code for the GAICO comparison graphs. 

The data section includes the 3 testcases and their results for each model. 

The project report analyzes why the results occurred, compares the different models performance, and gives a conclusion on the project.
